# Clean Code Handout

This project is for the Clean Code workshop! You'll get to experience cleaning up some dirty code, and then we can discuss your solutions and how this might apply to future projects you take on.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Node.js installed (specifically the version in the `.node-version` is preferrable). We recommend using a Node.js runtime manager (like nodenv or NVM) to help you install the right version. Next, you'll run the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm test` to check that all unit tests are passing!

## Exercise

We'll be practicing cleaning up the code in the `main.js` file. As you're cleaning up code, you can run `npm test` to make sure that the intended functionality of the codebase is still working properly!

1. Look for code smells in `main.js`
2. Refactor and clean up
3. Run `npm test` to make sure all tests are passing!

Happy coding!
